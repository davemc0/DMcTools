// Copyright Dave McAllister, 1998.

// Simulates my dad's old stop watch. It had a stop / start switch and a
// reset button that were independent. First press Reset(), then press
// Start(). Then press Stop() and then Read() it. Also, you can Read() it
// while it's going, and you can Start() and Stop() it multiple times
// without Reset()ing it, and the time will accumulate. Also, you can
// Reset() it while it is going and it will reset to 0 and go from there.
//
// Note that although the time is stored as a double, the clock is not very
// accurate. It has maybe 1 ms granularity or worse.
